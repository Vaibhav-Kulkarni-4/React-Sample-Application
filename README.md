# Setting Up The Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Install Dependencies

`npm install`

This installs all the dependencies required onto your machine.

### Start App and Mock Server Simultaneously

`npm run dev`

This commands runs the app in dev mode along with that, it starts the mock server.\
Saves time and energy :stuck_out_tongue:

### Start App (Optional)

#### No need to execute this if `npm run dev` is used

`npm run start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:300](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Start JSON Mock Server (Optional)

#### No need to execute this if `npm run dev` is used

`npm run json:server`

This starts the mock server with which you can make fake REST API calls. (AWESOME)\
Open [http://localhost:5000/members](http://localhost:5000/members) to view it in the browser.

### Make Arrangements To Deploy Application

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## UI Library Used

### `React Suite`

A suite of React components, sensible UI design, and a friendly development experience.\
